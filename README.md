## Natours is an e-commerce website application built for a fictional company as a portfolio piece from a course I took on full-stack development. It is a demonstratable example of fullstack development knowledge for consideration by potential employers.

&nbsp;

## It is available at https://natours-adams.herokuapp.com.

&nbsp;

## It is dynamically populated through an API from a database I created and allows a user to view information for the tours offered by the company, create an updatable account, purchase a tour, and view their itineraries.

&nbsp;

## The API has additional features built in for administrative purposes used during development and will be implemented in more depth at a later time.

&nbsp;

## Please see the table of contents below for more detailed information about the application and thank you for checking out this project!

# I. Use Instructions

Upon the application loading, a user may click on a tour card to view more detailed information about a tour. If a user would like to book a tour, they will either log into their account or create an account if they do not currently have one.

Then the user will then be allowed to click a book tour button that will then direct them to our checkout endpoint and complete the stripe checkout form. They will then be directed back to the main page.

If a user creates an account they have the ability to view and update their information through an icon link created at the upper right of the page. From the landing page of their account they can also view their trips purchased.

If you believe these instructions could use more clarification please feel free to reach out and I will look into a more thorough explanation in order to help prevent any confusion superduper.natours@manyme.com.

# IV. Future Implementation Plans

Future development will revolve around connecting more of the functionality of our API into the user experience such as an admin being able to use the GUI to create a new tour, guides being able to see who has booked one of their tours nad contact information for those persons, customers ability to leave a review once their trip has concluded and more. Lots to do still! ^\_^
